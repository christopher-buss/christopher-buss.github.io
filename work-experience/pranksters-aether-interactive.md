As a gameplay programmer at Aether Interactive, I was apart of a small team creating experiences on the roblox platform. Due to the nature of being in a small team, I was often expected to be more of a generalist programmer and pick up tasks in lots of different areas relating to: Gameplay, UI, , Testing, Networking, Game Design, Sound, Animation, etc.
