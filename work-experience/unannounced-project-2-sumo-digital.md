# ðŸ—º Unannounced Project 2 - Sumo Digital

As currently this project is still unannounced, I am unable to show any project visuals or discuss specific work that I participated in. However, I can still provide an overview of my work done and my skills used.

***

I worked as a gameplay programmer on an Unreal Engine 5 project in it's early stages as part of the 'World Look and Feel' team. This team was made up of game designers, level designers, tech artists and programmers. The direction for this team was to explore ideas surrounding the feel of the game.

My typical work involved developing level-object prototypes using blueprint, or taking prototypes developed by our technical designers, and then creating production-ready versions using C++.
