# ðŸŽµ About Me

Hey again! I'm Christopher. I graduated from Royal Holloway, University of London in 2023 with a First-Class Honours in Computer Science (Software Engineering), with a year in industry. I've been playing video games since I was very young, and I ðŸ’–multiplayer experiences with friends.

My favourite sort of games are thousand-hour games.&#x20;

> A game where you earn so much enthusiasm from your players that **they spend over a year playing it, for several hours every day**. Every single day.

I love games that I can come back to, over and over again, and they never get old. Games I've put 1000+ hours into are League of Legends, Roblox, Black Desert Online and Minecraft.

While I was at University I competed competively for both NUEL and NSE (two university esports leagues) on the university's first team for League of Legends, and I love to play games competitively. I peaked at Diamond 1 in Season 2020 (top 0.18% of players in europe), and was in the #1 guild in europe on Black Desert Online.

If you're not finding my making games or playing games, in my spare time I like to keep fit by going to the gym regularly and going on walks, playing the piano, or doing activities with friends (such as bouldering).
