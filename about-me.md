# ðŸ’¬ About Me

Hello once again! I'm Christopher. I graduated from Royal Holloway, University of London in 2023 with a First-Class Honours in Computer Science (Software Engineering), with a year in industry. My passion for video games dates back to my early years, and I particularly enjoy ðŸ’–multiplayer experiences with friends.

My favourite sort of games is "thousand-hour games".&#x20;

> A game where you earn so much enthusiasm from your players that **they spend over a year playing it, for several hours every day**. Every single day.

I love games that I can come back to, repeatedly, and yet the experience still seems to captivate, and never get old. Games like League of Legends, Roblox, Black Desert Online, and Minecraft fall into this category for me.

During my time at University, I competed competitively in both NUEL and NSE (two university esports leagues) as a member of the university's first team for League of Legends. I thrive on competitive gaming, and I achieved a peak rank of Diamond 1 in Season 2020, placing me in the top 0.18% of players in Europe. Additionally, I was part of the #1 guild in Europe on Black Desert Online.

Beyond the world of gaming and game development, I maintain an active lifestyle by regularly hitting the gym, going for walks, playing the piano, and engaging in activities like bouldering with friends during my leisure time.
