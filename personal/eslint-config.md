# ðŸŽ¨ ESLint Config

{% embed url="https://github.com/christopher-buss/roblox-ts-eslint-config" %}

***

This was originally based on [Antfu's eslint-config](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config) but has been modified to support my preferred style using prettier, a stricter set of rules than the default, along with native support for the roblox-ts-eslint-plugin. Many rules that do not apply to the roblox-ts ecosystem have been turned off.

This formulates apart of my commitment to clean code. I believe that an entire project should feel like it was written by one programmer, even if 100 different programmers have contributed to the codebase. Consistent codebases can only be achieved through professional tooling - and I believe the best course of action to any inconsistencies in a project is to find rules that can easily aleviate the discrepency (bonus points if it's auto-fixable!).
