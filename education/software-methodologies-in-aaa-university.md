# ðŸŽ“ Software Methodologies in AAA - University

As part of my University degree, I wrote a 15,000 word dissertation delving into how AAA studios could implement mainstream software methodologies, such as automated testing, to enhance the game development process. The research encompasses examples of automated testing within Unreal Engine 4, an in-depth exploration of essential software tools like Git and Perforce, discussions on Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), and an examination of design patterns. Additionally, the dissertation includes proof-of-concept programs designed to illustrate the theoretical aspects covered in the research.
