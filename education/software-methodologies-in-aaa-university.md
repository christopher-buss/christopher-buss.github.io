# ðŸ“ª Software Methodologies in AAA - University

As part of my University degree, I wrote a 15,000 word dissertation researching how AAA studios could implement mainstream software methodologies, such as automated testing, to enhance the development process when building games. Included are examples of automated testing using Unreal Engine 4, a deep dive into aspects of useful software such as Git and Perforce, CI/CI, and design patterns, along with some proof-of-concept programs to demonstrate the theoretical aspects covered.
